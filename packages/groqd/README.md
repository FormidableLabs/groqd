[![GROQD â€” Formidable, We build the modern web](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FormidableLabs/groqd/main/groqd-Hero.png)](https://formidable.com/open-source/groqd)

**[Check out the official documentation.](https://formidable.com/open-source/groqd)**

`groqd` is a schema-unaware, runtime-safe query builder for [GROQ](https://www.sanity.io/docs/groq). **The goal of `groqd` is to give you (most of) the flexibility of GROQ, with the runtime/type safety of [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) and TypeScript.**

`groqd` works by accepting a series of GROQ operations, and generating a query to be used by GROQ and a Zod schema to be used for parsing the associated GROQ response.

An illustrative example:

```ts
import { q } from "groqd";

// Get all of the Pokemon types, and the Pokemon associated to each type.
const { query, schema } = q("*")
  .filter("_type == 'poketype'")
  .grab({
    name: q.string(),
    pokemons: q("*")
      .filter("_type == 'pokemon' && references(^._id)")
      .grab({ name: q.string() }),
  });

// Use the schema and the query as you see fit, for example:
const response = schema.parse(await sanityClient.fetch(query));

// At this point, response has a type of:
// { name: string, pokemons: { name: string }[] }[]
// ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†
```
