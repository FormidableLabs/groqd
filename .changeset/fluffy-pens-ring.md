It's official! GroqD 1.0 is here!

This brand-new version of GroqD adds **schema-awareness**, which brings massive improvements to the developer experience!

This includes:

- **Auto-completion** - write queries quickly and confidently
- **Runtime validation** - ensure data integrity, catch errors early
- **Transformation** - map values at runtime, like parsing dates
- **Fragments** - create reusable query fragments, and compose queries from other fragments

This release does include breaking API changes. Please see the [migration docs](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/groqd/docs/migration) for more information.
